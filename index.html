                      Dominate the world from Africa's highest peaks, catch the
                      first rays of sunrise to enjoy unique glaciers and watch
                      the world shrink around you. Experience the majesty of
                      these ancient rock formations and see them towering above
                      the vast expanse of land that surrounds them, bringing
                      heaven closer to you. African mountains are both easy and
                      difficult to climb, making them popular with a wide range
                      of experienced and novice climbers. The popular routes on
                      Mount Kenya include Sirimon, which is a beginner-friendly,
                      relatively straightforward climb with wildlife and
                      distinctive foliage. Chogoria is the ideal safari-hiking
                      destination because of its magnificent gorges, caverns,
                      tarns, waterfalls, lakes, and animals. You can ascend
                      Mount Kilimanjaro's Uhuru peak through the Machame,
                      Lemosho, Umbwe, or Rongai routes. Depending on the route
                      and individual preferences, lodging options include camps
                      and cottages. We have equipment available for technical
                      climbers to reach Mount Kenya's Nelion and Batian summits.

                    <h5>Coastal beach tours</h5>
                    <p>
                      For those who reach Kenya's coastline, Mombasa, a mashup
                      of languages and cultures from all sides of the Indian
                      Ocean, awaits like an exotic dessert. Mombasa's blend of
                      India, Arabia, and Africa can be seductive, and many
                      visitors find themselves drawn in despite its grit and
                      sleaze, which strangely just adds to the location's great
                      allure. It shares more similarities with Dakar or Dar es
                      Salaam than Nairobi. Compromises are a part of life, but
                      when it comes to safaris, we think you can have it all.
                      Whether it's a honeymoon, a family vacation, or an
                      extension of a safari's game drives, a beach vacation tops
                      the list of relaxation options for many travellers. With
                      the best islands and coasts, Africa offers a wide range of
                      recreational opportunities. There are private beaches
                      where you can soak up the sun or stroll along the shore
                      with your feet in the sand, tan naturally. At Wasini in
                      Mombasa, you may dive and swim with dolphins to escape the
                      heat. If swimming isn't your thing, you can take a boat
                      out to see the sea life. We handpick the best restaurants
                      for freshly caught, high quality, and well-prepared sea
                      food, as well as spas for maximum relaxation. The coast
                      region is rich in culture and history, dating back to
                      pre-colonial times when slavery was a profitable business.
                      Our knowledgeable guides ensure that you get the most out
                      of your time on any beach in Africa.

                    <p>
                      Expect the ULTIMATE EXHILARATION as you drop into valleys
                      and soar over mountains with the wind in your face. Having
                      your own wings allows you to explore Kenya's most remote,
                      spectacular, and extreme locations. Places previously
                      inaccessible by land and unexplored by humans are now at
                      your fingertips. This allows you to visit some of Kenya's
                      most remote geographical wonders. Looking down from above
                      on Kenya's vast wilderness provides an entirely new
                      perspective. A helicopter offers unrivaled spontaneity and
                      freedom: rapid access to inaccessible sites that would
                      otherwise be impossible due to time constraints, as well
                      as exceptional maneuverability. Fly above animals like
                      kenyan giraffes and rhinos or land next to a turquoise
                      pool for a cooling dip. This is why we can give you a
                      once-in-a-lifetime chance to visit the wildest parts of
                      the country during your luxury Kenya safari vacation.

                    We had never traveled with Fidellis Tours before (We were
                    told about this company by a friend, who said "He had a
                    great time"). Kim served as our tour guide the entire time.
                    Overall, due to Kim, it was a wonderful experience. When it
                    came to private safari excursions, he was very informed,
                    experienced, and connected, which allowed us to see some
                    incredible wildlife encounters. When it came to carrying out
                    tasks that weren't on the agenda, he was incredibly
                    understanding and adaptable. He is incredibly cordial and
                    organized, and he always had the automobile ready the night
                    before. The journey was made worthwhile by Kim, and I hope
                    to repeat the adventure in the future.

                    From July 31 to August 5, we traveled to Kenya and saw
                    Amboseli, Naivasha, Nakuru, and the Masai Mara. Fidellis
                    organized every aspect of our trip. From the moment we made
                    the reservation for the tour until we left this stunning
                    nation, Fidellis kept in touch with us well and made sure we
                    were comfortable at all times. Our appointed guide/driver
                    made sure we completed the entire schedule and gave
                    fantastic service. Together, they ensured that all hotel
                    reservations, meals, and other necessities were made well in
                    advance. Along with other items on the schedule, we see the
                    Big 5 and the Great Mara Crossing. Overall, I had the nicest
                    experience I could have.
