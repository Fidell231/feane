                    <h5>Mt. Kenya - Chogoria route</h5>
                    <p>
                      On your 5-day ascent of Mount Kenya through the Chogoria
                      Route, take in stunning scenery and breathtaking mountain
                      views. This path will take you through fairy forests and
                      moorlands, crossing tall waterfalls and babbling streams,
                      and will range in difficulty from easy treks to hard
                      ascents. In the lower mountain area, be careful to keep an
                      eye out for elephants, buffaloes, and antelopes. You stay
                      in lovely Lake Ellis for one night and can see Lake
                      Michaelson from Mintos Camp. Along the Sirimon Route, your
                      return journey passes through the expansive Mackinder's
                      Valley. Our knowledgeable team will take the helm and make
                      sure you reach the summit and descend safely. &nbsp;

                      population and critically endangered species. In addition
                      to having one of the greatest elephant herds in East
                      Africa, the region is also one of the last remaining safe
                      havens for the critically endangered black rhinoceros.
                      Numerous conservancies in the area are home to resorts and
                      campers that provide a plethora of activities for guests
                      to do while they are there.The relatively flat landscape
                      makes horseback riding, camel rides, mountain biking, and
                      much more possible, making it a perfect getaway for both
                      families and couples. Combine that with A Samburu safari
                      will introduce you to Kenya's parched, wild north. One of
                      Kenya's best safari experiences involves a game drive into
                      this untamed wilderness, where you can encounter the rare
                      Samburu Special Five, which includes the beisa oryx,
                      reticulated giraffe, Grevy's zebra, gerenuk antelope, and
                      Somali ostrich. Although most people go on safari to see
                      the animals, I also value the countryside. Samburu differs
                      from other Kenyan reserves in terms of scenery. It's
                      fascinating to have land-forms on the horizon rather than
                      just miles and miles of grassland plains because the
                      diversity of the savannah, woods, and mountains is a
                      lovely combination. Complete your tour in Meru National
                      Park, its located in the desolate wilderness of northern
                      Kenya, a long way from the usual safari routes. A Meru
                      safari, one of Kenya's top safari experiences, will take
                      you through dry terrain accentuated by the famous baobab
                      and doum palm trees and home to numerous herds of
                      elephant, lion, and rhino. This park is located in Kenya's
                      untamed northern wastes and was made famous by George and
                      Joy Adamson in the book and film Born Free. Meru has all
                      the necessary components for a traditional safari,
                      including great chances to view elephant, lion, and rhino,
                      as well as an environment with parched hill region,
                      swift-moving streams, and riverine forests. Additionally,
                      Mount Kenya is to the northeast, and you commonly see it
                      in the background. &nbsp; Contact us for a personalized

                    <p>
                      One of Kenya's most well-known parks is the Amboseli
                      National Parks, which is crowned by Mount Kilimanjaro,
                      Africa's highest peak. One of the best spots in Africa to
                      see big herds of elephants up close is Amboseli, which is
                      a Maasai word that means "salty dust." After Masai Mara,
                      Amboseli National Park is the most visited game park in
                      Kenya. It is home to a wide variety of animals, including
                      buffalo, leopards, spotted hyenas, giraffes, antelopes,
                      and cheetahs. In addition to other African creatures like
                      impalas, lions, zebras, and wildebeest, mboseli national
                      park is home to an abundance of wildlife, with an

                    <p>
                      For real adventure, come to the Chalbi Desert instead of
                      the Sahara, Kalahari, or Namib deserts. As you taste camel
                      milk, interact with the locals, including the Rendile and
                      Samnuru. Kenya's Northern area is big and beautiful. It is
                      the home to numerous tribes and has up until now been
                      comparatively inaccessible. Its scenery is diverse,
                      enigmatic, and breathtakingly beautiful, ranging from the
                      lush highland green of the southern side of the Mathews
                      range and Samburu National Park to the red sands of the
                      northern borders with Ethiopia in the Chalbi desert.

                    <p>
                      Kenya's Northern area is big and beautiful. You may camp
                      at the summit of Mt. Ololokwe and hike up the elephant
                      trails to experience some of the most breathtaking sunsets
                      and sunrises.Ololokwe is not by itself. It is joined by
                      two smaller mountains, forming a horseshoe shape
                      surrounding a valley with a single entrance. The name of
                      this location, Sabache, was inspired by the Samburu
                      woman's necklace clasp, a beauty icon in their culture.
                      The Mathews Range, Cat & Mouse, and adjacent plains are
                      all readily visible from the mountain's southern end,
                      providing breathtaking vistas. The trail will follow
                      steep, acacia-covered elephant and cow tracks. The ascent
                      is roughly 1000M in total. The moderate trek will take 3–4
                      hours to complete. Come to this interesting location with
                      the home of mountain lovers for enjoyment, connection, and
                      self-discovery.&nbsp; Contact us for a personalized

                    <h5>Nairobi - Nakuru - Kisumu tour</h5>
                    <p>
                      Nairobi is the only Capital City in the world with a
                      National Park. Made of open grass plains and scattered
                      acacia bush, the park is home to Africa’s Big five—Rhino,
                      Elephant, Lion, Buffalo and Leopard—as well as other hosts
                      of wildlife like Zebras, Antelopes, Giraffes, wildebeest,
                      baboons and birds. The park has picnic sites, should you
                      wish to go for a picnic, three campsites and walking
                      trails for hikers. And the beauty of it, the park is only
                      a few minutes drive from the Central Business District.
                      Proceed to the newest city in Kenya, Nakuru. home to Lake
                      Nakuru, Africa's first bird sanctuary, and the Menengai,
                      the second-largest volcanic crater still in existence.
                      It's a great location for seeing a variety of wildlife,
                      exploring the city, and looking about for interesting
                      historical sites.Tourists go great distances to visit Lake
                      Nakuru because of its flamboyant pink-feathered flamingos
                      and nearly extinct white rhino species. Visit the Menengai
                      Crater, a volcano that is dormant in the Nakuru region.
                      Wars between Masai tribes have reportedly occurred in the
                      past. Ask any local, and you'll hear tales of battle and
                      men interred between the craters.Visit the second-best
                      Lake Elementaita, which is stunning and amazing and is
                      located between Nakuru and Naivasha. Site of Hyrax Hill:
                      Men from the Neolithic era lived in the Nakuru area?
                      Surprised? Oh no, don't. Nearly 3,000 years ago, the
                      central rift valley area was settled by prehistoric
                      people. Head Westwards to Kisumu, a city in Kenya that is
                      on the shorvs of Lake Victoria. Wildlife viewing is a
                      well-liked pastime, particularly for visitors to Kisumu
                      and its surroundings. The Kisumu Impala Sanctuary is home
                      to herds of impalas, as its name suggests, and is situated
                      about a kilometer from Kisumu's central business district
                      on the road that goes to Lake Victoria. The lake has many
                      pleasant beaches, though the majority are undeveloped and
                      do not allow swimming. However, there is still the peace
                      and quiet that you can find on any beach, as well as a
                      nice, calming breeze that will help you unwind. For
                      picnics and sundowners by the lake, Hippo Point is a
                      wonderful observation location. Another fantastic location
                      from which to go boating and see hippos and several bird
                      species is Dunga Beach. Kisumu offers the best sunsets
                      ever.&nbsp; Contact us for a personalized itinerary and

                    <p>
                      Mombasa, also known as Kisiwa Cha Mvita or Island of War
                      in Swahili, is not only Kenya's largest coastal metropolis
                      but also a fascinating fusion of African, Indian, and
                      Arabic cultures. It is intense and cosmopolitan, but it
                      also has lots of beaches, lively markets, and museums.
                      There are many possibilities to experience Swahili culture
                      here as well as barefoot luxury seaside resorts, such as
                      those found at Nyali Beach, Bamburi Beach, Shanzu Beach,
                      Kikambala Beach, and Kilifi Beach.The Malindi and Watamu
                      beaches are known for their dazzling white sand, national
                      marine reserves, attractive old town restaurants, and a
                      relaxed, multinational scene. There are numerous resorts,
                      villas, and spas to choose from.Long, low, and relaxed
                      best describe Diani Beach. The majority of the hotels and
                      resorts are tucked away on this immaculate, lengthy
                      stretch of faultless beach that is bordered by a lush
                      facade of forest. The beach here is laid-back with a
                      colorful mix of families, travelers, water-sports
                      enthusiasts, nomads, and honeymooners. It has been named
                      three times as Africa's top beach destination. You may
                      relax in a hammock, go snorkeling in the clear waters, and
                      when you get bored, go on a safari!. At Wasini in Mombasa,
                      you may dive and swim with dolphins to escape the heat. If
                      swimming isn't your thing, you may watch the marine life
                      from a boat and learn about how it exists in its natural
                      environment.&nbsp; Contact us for a personalized itinerary

                    <h5>Maasai Mara Safari</h5>
                    <p>
                      There are undulating hills, vast savannahs, daring river
                      crossings, and, of course, more wildlife and adventure
                      than any movie has ever been able to capture. Welcome to
                      the Masai Mara, which is also the temporary home of the
                      "Great Migration," the lions from "Big Cat Diary," the
                      Maasai warriors, and some of the world's most opulent
                      safari resorts. The Masai Mara is home to an amazing
                      kaleidoscope of untamed and rocky terrain, friendly
                      locals, and a plethora of fascinating animals, both large
                      and little. Every year from July through October, the
                      Masai Mara, which is known for hosting the magnificent
                      Great Migration, welcomes 1.5 million wildebeests into its
                      vast savannahs. The conservancies and Masai Mara National
                      Reserve are teeming with life and provide safari goers
                      with a wide range of activities to choose from.You will
                      undoubtedly leave the Masai Mara with lifelong memories
                      and unique experiences, whether you choose to travel by
                      4x4 safari or take to the sky for a morning hot-air
                      balloon excursion.Along with migratory wildebeest and
                      zebra, the reserve is a photographer and naturalist's
                      dream with its abundance of elephant, buffalo, giraffe,
                      lion, and cheetah. Leopards are commonly seen, endangered
                      black rhino hide in dense undergrowth, and the Mara River
                      is home to huge crocodiles and rafts of hippopotamuses.
                      Over 450 different bird species can be found in the park.

                    <h5>Tsavo safari</h5>
                    <p>
                      Together, Tsavo East and Tsavo West make up one of the
                      largest national parks in the world, occupying 4% of
                      Kenya. The huge open landscapes of Tsavo East NP are
                      captivating; it has a wild, unexplored feeling. Most
                      safari species reside in the vast, semi-arid wilderness,
                      and despite low wildlife numbers, it is always feasible to
                      see animals here due to the lack of vegetation.The Big
                      Five are all found in Tsavo East. Elephants thrive in the
                      park, where they frequently have a reddish look due to the
                      region's peculiar red soil. The lions in Tsavo are
                      renowned for lacking manes. The fringe-eared oryx is one
                      of the many dry country specialties that may be found
                      here; it is the most regional.Miles of wide-open plains,
                      lush grassland, and semi-arid shrub can be found in Tsavo
                      . A prominent feature of the park is the Galana River,
                      which is bordered by riverine forests. Mudanda Rock, a
                      colossal quartzite (hard, metamorphic rock) formation, is
                      another picturesque attraction. Tsavo experiences hot, dry
                      weather all year long, with the exception of its upper
                      elevations, when temperatures drop off as you climb the
                      hills. The transition period between the so-called "short
                      rains" at the end of the year and those of the subsequent
                      "long rains" during the Wet season is exceptionally hot.
                      There is some heat respite during the dry season (June to
                      September).The park is known for having quite a number of
                      Lions that were sometime termed as the “Man-Eaters” and
                      other animal species like the large herds of elephants.

                    <p>
                      We provide a wonderful experience with panoramic views of
                      the East African flora and fauna while you relax in the
                      luxury of your private (Chopper) chopper with your own
                      guide and pilot. Our pilots will provide you with an
                      unforgettable experience since they have intimate local
                      knowledge of the places we visit and a genuine love for
                      the continent. Rent or rent a helicopter for touristic
                      sightseeing ventures out of Kenya.This gives you the
                      chance to visit some of Kenya's most secluded natural
                      treasures. A completely different viewpoint is provided by
                      looking down on Kenya's immense wilderness from above. The
                      spontaneity and freedom of a helicopter are unmatched:
                      benefit from immediate access to isolated sites that would
                      otherwise be impractical due to time constraints, as well
                      as outstanding maneuverability. Hover over animals like a
                      rhinoceros and a kenyan giraffe, or land next to a
                      turquoise pool for a cooling dip. For this reason, The
                      Safari Collection has its own helicopter and pilot,
                      enabling us to provide you a once-in-a-lifetime chance to
                      visit the most remote areas of Kenya during your luxury
                      safari vacation. Price varies depending on hours and

                    <h5>Lake Turkana</h5>
                    <p>
                      The 7 million-hectare Lake Turkana, in Kenya's Northern
                      Frontier, is the largest desert lake in the world. The
                      lake's length exceeds 290 kilometers, its depth is 30
                      meters, and its widest point is 32 kilometers. With only a
                      little portion of the northern tip stretching into
                      Ethiopia, the majority of the lake is entirely contained
                      within Kenyan territory. While Lake Turkana is famous for
                      its enormous size, our visitors are also fascinated by the
                      water's unusual greenish-blue tint, known as "jade," which
                      is brought on by the presence of algae. More than 40
                      different fish species have been identified to exist
                      beneath the surface of the Jade Sea, but the most
                      recognizable predators are the Nile crocodiles, which sun
                      themselves along the coastlines. Migratory birds can stop
                      at Sibiloi National Park, the South and North Islands, and
                      the Central Island of the lake, which has a small active
                      volcano . You might get to interact with people from the
                      Rendille, Gabra, Samburu, Turkana, El Molo, Ariaal, and
                      Dassanech tribes that rely on Lake Turkana and the
                      surrounding nature to survive.Each of these native peoples
                      has adapted to the challenging surroundings by learning
                      essential skills like deep lake fishing, gathering wild
                      fruit and honey, and herding animals and camels. Lake
                      Turkana and the national parks that surround it were
                      chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to the variety
                      of flora and wildlife, ecological importance of the
                      region, and the relevance of archaeological and
                      paleoanthropological finds on a global scale.&nbsp;

                    <h5>Samburu - Chalbi - Turkana tour</h5>
                    <p>
                      Start at Buffalo Springs, Shaba, and Samburu National
                      Reserves The Samburu National Reserve is located in
                      Kenya's Rift Valley Province in the southeast portion of
                      the Samburu District. It is divided from the Buffalo
                      Springs National Reserve to the south by the Ewaso Nyiro
                      River. The distinctive 5 animal species—the Grevy Zebra,
                      Somali Ostrich, Reticulated Giraffe, Gerenuk, and Beisa
                      Oryx—as well as a broad variety of other wildlife species
                      are abundant in the reserve. Head north to Marsabit
                      National Park that encompasses the enormous extinct
                      volcano known as Mount Marsabit and is a secluded mountain
                      wonderland situated in Kenya's rough northern frontier.
                      Despite having been formed by volcanic eruption, Mt.
                      Marsabit is a cool, forested region that is frequently
                      shrouded in mist. Mount Marsabit is well-known for the
                      iridescent blue waters of Lake Paradise, which is located
                      at its summit and rises like a mirage over the surrounding
                      scorching desert. Top your tour by visiting. Park National
                      Sibiloi Koobi Fora, where the fossil remains have given
                      more to our understanding of human evolution than any
                      other site in the continent, is one of the most
                      significant archaeological sites in Sibiloi, which is
                      situated on the wild and mountainous shores of Lake
                      Turkana, the cradle of mankind. Zebras, Grant gazelles,
                      lions, leopards, striped hyenas, Beisa oryx, greater kudu,
                      cheetahs, and northern topi are just a few of the species
                      of terrestrial animals. Travel to Chalbi desert,The Chalbi
                      Desert, which spans 100,000 square kilometers (38,610
                      square miles) and is located southwest of the isolated
                      Lake Turkana, is appropriately dubbed "salty and naked" in
                      the Gabra language. The basin that fills with shallow
                      water following heavy rains and the petrified remains of
                      snail shells and fish vertebrae are both signs that the
                      desert, like many other regions in the Northern Frontier,
                      was once a portion of a large lake.Prepare yourself for a
                      strange scene bordered by rocky lava flows, fractured
                      earth, and a sand-filled mixture of white salt and clay as
                      you travel through the Chalbi Desert. Beautiful palm tree
                      groves and oases with sand grouse and other birds, such
                      vulturine guinea fowls, can be found on the northern edge.
                      The Gabra tribe also use the oasis as watering holes for
                      their camels. The Huri Hills and Mount Forole to the
                      north, at the Kenya-Ethiopia border, are another
                      contrasting landscape in the desert. Here, temperatures
                      are a little bit lower and the wilderness is a lot
                      greener, giving you a private escape from the desert heat
                      while enjoying expansive views of the hottest place in the
                      Kenya.Finaly rest at lake Turkana ending your tour.&nbsp;

                    <h5>Off-roading trip</h5>
                    <p>
                      It's simple to overlook Kenya's excellent off-road routes
                      when enjoying a white-sand beach vacation and going on
                      safari to see the Big Five. You could be wandering through
                      luxuriant emerald-green forests or along a crater ridge
                      with views over a glistening lake, spotting colobus
                      monkeys scampering across the route, and taking in wide
                      valleys, baobabs, and acacia trees as the sun sets while
                      exploring this country. The trails in Kenya are popular
                      with SUVs and all-terrain vehicles as well as motorcycles.
                      Kenya features a wide range of treks, routes, and trails
                      to suit any level, from the nation's highest peak, Mt.
                      Kenya, to the picturesque, flat paths through parks and
                      reserves in the Kenyan soils. None of the paths are overly
                      crowded, and many provide actual peace and quiet.&nbsp;

                    <h5>Ngare Ndare hike</h5>
                    <p>
                      Ngare Ndare, which in Masai means "Waterfall of the Gods,"
                      is aptly titled. You will be astounded by the unspoiled
                      splendor of this extraordinary location, which is the
                      closest thing to heaven that you have yet to see and is by
                      far the most beautiful in Kenya. One of the nicest sites
                      to visit is the Ngare Ndare forest, which appears to have
                      been overlooked by tourists. A rich indigenous woodland,
                      Ngare Ndare, may be found at the northern foothills of
                      Mount Kenya. At the base of waterfalls, azure ponds
                      sparkle, and 200-year-old trees reach into the canopy,
                      providing habitat for a wide variety of birds and other
                      animals. Elephants have been using the forest for decades
                      as a critical link between the Mount Kenya Forest Reserve
                      and the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Northern Kenya. The
                      Ngare Ndare Forest Trust was established to promote the
                      development of the local community while ensuring
                      long-term conservation of the Ngare Ndare forest.
                      Communities participate in decision-making to conserve
                      animals and natural resources while enhancing their
                      standard of living by conserving the forest as a crucial
                      water tower in northern Kenya.&nbsp; Contact us for a

                    <p>
                      The city that never sleeps is Nairobi. Nairobi awakens in
                      the shape of nightclubs, eateries servicing its patrons,
                      and revelers pausing to take in life when other cities
                      turn in by 9:00 p.m. Crowds of Nairobi residents keep the
                      city vibrant along Mombasa Road, Westlands, and the CBD.
                      The nightlife in Nairobi won't let you down if you like
                      it. You can be sure that Nairobi will have something to
                      suit your preferences. Follow your conviction if you've
                      decided that Nairobi should be your next travel
                      destination.The nightlife scene in Kenya's capital city
                      epitomizes the city's reputation for being larger than
                      life. After evening, residents, foreigners, and tourists
                      mix in places like upscale champagne bars and nightclubs
                      that pulse with energizing African beats. Kenyans rely
                      heavily on music to let go, and you can find it here in
                      every genre and environment conceivable. Keep an ear out
                      for the Nairobi-born hip hop subgenre known as genge in
                      particular. There are bars and clubs all across the city.

                    <h5>Great Rift valley tour</h5>
                    <p>
                      Rich natural resources are present in the Rift Valley
                      area. The majority of Kenya's lakes are located in this
                      area, where huge bird populations can be found.
                      Additionally, the Rift Valley is home to numerous
                      historical and ancient sites. It has incredible wildlife,
                      including the Big Five, which accounts for the abundance
                      of parks, reserves, and conservancies. As a result, it
                      provides ideal locations for breathtaking safaris. The 11
                      Kalenjin sub-tribes, the Samburu, and the Maasai are just
                      a few of the many cultures found in the Rift Valley. As a
                      result, the area provides a variety of cuisines.The
                      majority of lakes in Kenya are situated on either side of
                      the Rift Valley, including Lakes Nakuru, Elementaita, and
                      Naivasha in Nakuru County, Lake Kamnarok in
                      Elgeyo-Marakwet, Lakes Baringo and Bogoria in Baringo
                      County, and others that are among the greatest tourist
                      destinations in the area.Popularly recognized as the
                      flamingo and other bird species' habitat, Lake Nakuru
                      National Park is a stunning natural paradise. Visitors can
